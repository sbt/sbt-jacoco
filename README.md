This is an [sbt](http://scala-sbt.org/) plugin for code coverage analysis via [JaCoCo](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/).
Supports uploading results to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io), [Codecov](https://codecov.io) and [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/).

Install the plugin by adding the following to `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.sbt" % "sbt-jacoco" % "<version>")
```

And then execute the plugin with `sbt jacoco`. This will instrument and run the unit tests and output the coverage
metrics:

```

A detailed HTML report will also be generated in the directory shown that includes line level details of coverage.

See the [docs](http://scala-sbt.org/sbt-jacoco) for details on configuration options.
